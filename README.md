As we will be using Python for this project then we will use the Python naming conventions:

# Python Conventions:
- Naming:
  - variable names (including class and instance), function names (including methods), and parameter names: snake_case (Ex: my_var, my_func(my_parameter))
  - constants: UPPER_CASE (Ex: MY_CONSTANT)
  - modules: lowercase (Ex: mymodule)
  - classes: UpperCaseCamelCase (Ex: MyClass)
- Style:
  - You can go and read: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/ (If in doubt just ask me, Yarik, but it is optional to read it)
  - Use 4 spaces per indentation level (should be the default length for tab)

# Branches:
- Everyone has their own branches
- Branches are limited in scope and should be pulled/merged quickly to the main
- Naming convention for branches: <developer_name>/<feature> Ex: yarik/a-feature
