 GitHub for the Sporks Team during the Hack the Change Hackathon 2022

As we will be using Python for this project then we will use the Python naming conventions:

# Java Conventions:
- Classes: UpperCamelCase (Ex: ImageSprite)
- Methods: lowerCamelCase (Ex: runProcess())
- Variables: lowerCamelCase (Ex: myVar)

# Branches:
- Everyone has their own branches
- Branches are limited in scope and should be pulled/merged quickly to the main
- Naming convention for branches: <developer_name>/<feature> Ex: yarik/a-feature
