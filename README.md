# Sporks-Hack-the-Change-2022
 GitHub for the Sporks Team during the Hack the Change Hackathon 2022

## About this project:
- This is a Java Swing application that tracks how long food items have been in the fridge.
- The goal of this project was to address one of the questions of the hackathon: How to promote healthy eating?
- The application has two main parts: The Cart and the Fridge

### The Cart:
- Add food items to the Cart
- Remove food items from the Cart
- Send food items to the Fridge to start the specialized countdown until it expiration

### The Fridge:
- See the list of food items and days until expiry
- Remove items that have been eaten

## Other:
- For all of us, this was our first hackathon. 
- As we decided to use Java for this project so we used its naming conventions.

## Java Conventions:
- Classes: UpperCamelCase (Ex: ImageSprite)
- Methods: lowerCamelCase (Ex: runProcess())
- Variables: lowerCamelCase (Ex: myVar)

## Branches:
- Everyone has their own branches
- Branches are limited in scope and should be pulled/merged quickly to the main
- Naming convention for branches: <developer_name>-<feature> Ex: yarik-feature
